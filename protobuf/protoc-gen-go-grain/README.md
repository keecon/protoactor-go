If you are using `protoc`, you need to ensure the required dependencies are available to the compiler at compile time. These can be found by manually cloning and copying the relevant files from here and providing them to protoc when running. The files you will need are:
```
protobuf/protoc-gen-go-grain/options/options.proto
```
